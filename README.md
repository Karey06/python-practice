# 2. COMPUTE FACTORIAL USING LOOP
It calculates the factorial for a number using a for loop.
It works by multiplying numbers from 1 upto the given number

# 3. EVEN OR ODD NUMBER
It checks if a number is even or odd.
It works by using the modulus operator % to check if a number is divisible by 2

# 4. RECURSIVE FACTORIAL
It calculates factorial of a number through recursion.
It works when the function calls itself multiplying number by the factorial of one less than the number until it reaches 1

# 5. REVERSE A STRING
It reverses a given string manually without using python's slicing.
It works by using a loop to build the reversed string character by character

# 6. SUM OF DIGITS OF A NUMBER
It adds all the digits in a number.
It works by extracting each digit using modulus %  10 and division of integers
